# maslo-persona-2d
Want to add a cute and adorable personified entity to your AI project? YOU HAVE COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE! From the makers of the highly popular toy BB-8 comes Maslo... an animated expressive empathetic entity. Use Maslo on a website, mobile phone, or anywhere you'd like.  

## Persona Module
You can think of the persona as the companion's ‘face’. This is a mathematically expressed amorphous shape. This shape consists of multiple properties (ie: size, speed, brightness, complexity, color, etc) that change based on user inputs and interaction. Every user can have a unique persona and their persona will evolve over time. 

## Persona Reactions
Each persona will react to the user inputs through animations that include visual changes, sound, color, and haptic feedback. You can play with the reactions here: (https://heymaslo.github.io/maslo-persona-2d/)
The types of reactions described below:
* State Reaction: A reaction is a particular audiovisual response from the persona. 
* Dynamic Idle: An anthropomorphised animation based on average of computed sentiment.
